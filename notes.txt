alembic.ini contains db url
i.e.
sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@db:5432/mydb
note: the host is db because it is geared for docker compose 
if local development (non docker) is preferred, change these details 


Migrating new/ammended tables
1. make sure all are tables in alembic/env.py
2. run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message"
3. alembic upgrade head

Using docker compose
    - the entrypoint.sh runs alembic upgrade head because 
    docker container will have a copy of the alembic migrations
    - no need to run migrations manually, let docker do it


entrypoint.sh is used to make sure that fastapi/migration does not run
before postgresql is running and accepting connections.

Docker compose has all the needed env variables
however, if you want to run local (non docker) make sure you have
.env
.example_env contain some example values needed inside .env


Make sure to use virtualenv (or similar) on local development.
